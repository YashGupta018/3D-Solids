# 3D-Solids

1) Displays a static picture of three cyan solids lit by a single yellow light source.
2) Shows that lighting, like depth buffering, is something that must be enabled.
Uses ambient, diffuse and specular parameters for lighting.
3) Uses a directional light source, as opposed to a point light source.
4) Illustrates three of the GLUT easy shape functions.
5) Each object is independently moved into the viewing volume, showing the importance of ```glPushMatrix``` and ```glPopMatrix```.
